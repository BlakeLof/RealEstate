# Overview
This software is a basic structure of a Real estate bidding interface. It will allow users to bid on listings, create listing, view listing, and remove listings. It uses a Hashmap to store all these listings and contains 2 interfaces. 

I wrote this software as a demonstration of my ability with the Java language. However it does work as a real estate interface, just back end functions.
